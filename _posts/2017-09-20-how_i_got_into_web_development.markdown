This is my first blog post so I’d like to introduce myself and tell you what got me here. I live in Indiana, not exactly the center of the tech industry but it's a great place to live. Also close to where I grew up. I was a flight instructor at my college while I worked on a bachelors in Technology. After that, I worked at a great company named Samtec. I spent the seven years with Samtec. It is a great place to work and I absolutely loved it.

So, why would I change careers to become a developer then? Well, I’ve been playing around with code for the last year on various free resources such as the Flatiron Bootcamp Prep, books, tutorials, and every developers favorite resource: Documentation! I love the challenge. The decision to study software development full time was clear, when after work or on breaks I would sneak away to code. So I made a plan and prepared for bootcamp. Flatiron Online Web Developer program happened to be a perfect fit for the goals I laid out when planning my career change.

I’m excited to be working on code everyday, usually from the comfort of my home, sometimes at a coffee shop, and sometimes in an AirBnB while traveling. Coding is incredibly exciting because of that. You can do it anywhere. I did most of my bootcamp prep in Canada while my partner was working in Toronto. How cool is that? Being able to study, create, and fix code from anywhere in the world is one of the most alluring aspects of web development.

Web development is a great place to begin to hone in on coding concepts and skills. Whether it is making new or fixing broken code it is a very rewarding task. Even when you may have broken some yourself, getting code to work feels amazing. It's been a very fun adventure starting this journey and I can’t wait to see where it takes me next.
