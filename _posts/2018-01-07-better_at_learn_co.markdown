I got into the idea of coding and I started consuming free resources and some less structured paid materials. It was a lot of learning a new concept and just moving on to the next one. I did this over and over again but I still had no clue how to build a simple app. How to piece any of the stuff I had learned together.
 
Working through Flatiron’s online bootcamp has been such a welcomed relief to the feeling of not being able to apply what I’m learning. I am feeling this whole new ball of energy because I am back to a familiar place writing JavaScript. Only now it's easy to picture how all the pieces can fit together to make something usable.

The course gives a great set of tools and the guidance of how to put it all together. The feedback loop from learning something and seeing it used for something meaningful is short enough to stay motivated. Having lessons curated and structured from a start to endpoint makes learning a lot more efficient.
