My time as a student at Learn.co is coming to an end. This whole journey has been a rewarding challenge. I can’t wait to use my knowledge to build awesome things.

For my final project I built a karaoke app because navigating YouTube for karaoke videos is pretty frustrating. It also is a great way for me to share some of the hard work I’ve been doing with friends.  

What I learned from this last section is that I’m not finished learning. Making the app was a bigger challenge than I expected. I could have made a very similar app with rails and jQuery but its important as a developer to continually update the technologies that you use. Programming best practices are always evolving and a good developer needs to stay current.

This was a reminder that I should always push myself to work where I’m not totally comfortable. React feels like a pretty comfortable place for me. Programming in an object oriented fashion just feels natural. Redux however, was quite a challenge because I had to break a lot of the patterns that I am most comfortable with to work in a FP (functional programming) style.

I’d say my biggest mistake working on this project is trying to get Redux working right away. I could have saved myself a lot of guessing by doing as much as I could do in React and then adding Redux after I get everything laid out in React. Redux and FP are great tools for debugging. With pure functions debugging is a lot easier because you don’t have data being mutated. FP is definitely a tool that I want to work with more and be ready to use when I need it.
