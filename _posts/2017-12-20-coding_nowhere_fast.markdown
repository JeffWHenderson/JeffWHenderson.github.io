The rails portfolio project gave me a couple take away lessons as I built it out. I didn’t know exactly what I wanted to build but I knew the requirements so I just started. THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.  Time spent planning can save tons of time spent coding. I wanted to work with devise since i still didn’t feel familiar enough with it and I knew no matter what I decided to make that the project would need user authentication. Working from the devise documentation I built out a user model and started imagining how my project could grow and what I could do with it.
 
I kept coding along building what I thought would meet requirements and trying to come up with a fun site that I would like to build. I did learn a lot as I tried things out, which is great as a student, but i also had to delete or redo a lot of my work later on. A lot of the rework I had to do was because of lack of planning. I was just eager to start and I didn’t really care if I was going to put some extra time into figuring things out later. This is very different from my normal workflow, and I’m glad I did it. Improvising is a skill that I want to have in case I need it but not something I want to make into a habit when I could plan better.
 
This project was still a lot of fun. I got to try new things out and really push my understanding of how rails works. I gave myself another challenge also by leaving the convenient Leard IDE provided by Flatiron and doing my project on Atom. I feel like I learned a lot from all the new challenges this project has given me.
